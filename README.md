MoodMosaic is an app that uses AI to help adolescents identify, understand, and manage their emotions in real time. By analyzing text inputs, our app can detect mood shifts and provide personalized recommendations to improve emotional health. Whether it’s uplifting music for sadness, calming exercises for stress, or confidence-building for anxiety, every suggestion is tailored to the individuals' needs and preferences. Our app includes features such as mood tracking and personalized activities based on their emotions. Ultimately, our app empowers users to take control of their emotional well-being and get customized support, helping them grow into confident, resilient individuals.
